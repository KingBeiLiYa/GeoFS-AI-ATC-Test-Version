GeoFS AI ATC is a browser extension (userscript) that brings intelligent Air Traffic Control to the GeoFS flight simulator. It supports multiple languages (Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English), interactive ATC workflow guidance, voice readback, custom command templates, advanced and beginner modes, and full ATC history export for flight debriefing.

**Key Features:**

- **Multi-language Support:** Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English, with all UI and tutorial texts adapting to your chosen language.
- **Drag-and-drop UI:** Easily reposition the ATC panel anywhere on your screen.
- **Real ATC Workflow Guidance:** Step-by-step ATC flow, with suggested commands at each stage (taxi, line up, takeoff, departure, cruise, arrival, landing, runway exit).
- **Command Templates:** Quick-select common ATC instructions via dropdown, plus add your own custom templates for frequently used commands.
- **Flexible Flight Input:** Enter multiple airports (including alternates), route points, and an optional flight plan; ATC will parse and respond accordingly.
- **Manual State Override:** Set aircraft status (ground/airborne/auto) for precise ATC logic.
- **Voice Broadcast:** ATC responses are read aloud using browser SpeechSynthesis for enhanced realism.
- **History & Review:** All ATC conversations are logged and can be exported for post-flight briefings.
- **Beginner/Advanced Modes:** Tailor the UI and available commands to your experience level.
- **On-demand Tutorial:** Access an interactive guide at any time, with content that adapts to your selected language.

**How to Use:**

1. Press **T** in GeoFS to open the ATC panel.
2. Fill in your flight details (callsign, departure/arrival airport, alternates, route, flight plan).
3. Select common instructions from the dropdown or enter custom ATC commands.
4. Review ATC history, export logs, or open the tutorial for help.
