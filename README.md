## Features

**1. ATC Panel with Flight Info Input**  
- The plugin provides a convenient ATC control panel where you can enter your aircraft callsign, departure and arrival airports, alternate airports, route points, and flight plan.
- All information is used to generate context-aware ATC replies, making the experience authentic.

**2. Multi-language Support**  
- Supports three languages: English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.
- You can switch the language at any time from the panel, and all commands and replies will be shown and spoken in your selected language.

**3. AI-generated ATC Replies**  
- Type standard ATC commands (e.g., “request taxi”, “request takeoff”, “report position”) or select them from a dropdown menu.
- The AI automatically interprets your input and responds with context-aware, realistic ATC instructions.

**4. Common and Custom Commands**  
- A dropdown menu lists common ATC commands for quick access.
- You can add your own custom commands, which will be saved locally and remain available for future sessions.

**5. Command History and Export**  
- Every ATC conversation is logged in the panel.
- You can export your ATC history to a text file for review or replay.

**6. Live Flight Status Display**  
- The panel shows real-time flight data: altitude, speed, heading, vertical speed, and whether you are airborne or on the ground.
- Data is updated automatically every second.

**7. Voice Broadcast with Adjustable Volume**  
- ATC replies are spoken aloud using browser text-to-speech (TTS).
- The volume slider lets you set the broadcast volume from 0% (mute) to 100% (max).
- Voice language matches the selected UI language.

**8. Easy Access and Draggable UI**  
- Open/close the ATC panel from the GeoFS toolbar button or by pressing the “T” key.
- The panel is fully draggable; move it anywhere on your screen.

**9. Beginner/Advanced Modes**  
- Choose between Beginner (fewer, most common commands) or Advanced (full command set) modes.
- Modes are switchable anytime for a personalized experience.

**10. Manual and Automatic Aircraft State Detection**  
- Set your aircraft as “Ground”, “Airborne”, or let the plugin detect it automatically.
- Useful for troubleshooting or custom scenarios.
